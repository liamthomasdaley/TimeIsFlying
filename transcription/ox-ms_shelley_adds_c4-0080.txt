In my [ST: weak] faint heart I dare not [ST: talk] speak
[ST: The] My thoughts; but thus disturbed & weak
I sat and watched the vefsels glide 
Along the ocean bright and wide
[ST: Like chariots? of an element] 
[ST: things 
Like spirit winged chariots sent
Oer some [ST: ???] ??? element
For inistrations strange & far;
As if to some Elysian  star
Thy [ST: most for some odor...]
Thy m
Such sweet & bitter pain as mine
[ST:I saw th drark rocks]
[ST: I watched the dark rocks frown & yawn
And the wind that [ST: ?] winde there flight
