	  <!--Most of the content on this page has not been transcribed. That is because most of the text represents 
	  the conclusion to The Triumph of Life, which is available elsewhere. However, one line of text does in fact pertain to 
	  "Time is flying." On this draft page (f. 52v), above “Those soonest, from whose limbs the” under "have fallen" and to the left 
	  of "way side" there appear, in tiny characters, in the same ink, the words “Alas I kiss you” followed by a disputed word, 
	  written with a drying nib and read as “Jane” (1960), “Julie” (1965), and “[  ?  ]” (BSM). These words were evidently squeezed in 
	  after drafting the surrounding lines (probably immediately after, certainly within the same composition session, 
	  before they slipped his mind for refinement later. -->
