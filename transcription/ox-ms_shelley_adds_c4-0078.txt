Bright wanderer, fair coquette of Heaven,
To whom alone it has been given
To change and be adored for ever,
Envy not this dim world, for never 
But once within its shadow grew
One fair as you but far more true
She left me at the silent time
When the moon had ceased to climb
The azure [ST:dome] ^[ST:path]^ of Heaven’s [ST:deep,] steep
And like an albatross asleep
[ST:Heaven*] Balanced on her wings of light.
Hovered in the purple night —
[ST: XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX XXX]
Ere she [ST:XXX XXX XXX] ^sought her ocean^ nest,
In the chambers of the west. —
She left me, and I [ST:XXX] ^staid^ alone
Thinking over every tone,
Which though now silent to the ear
The enchanted heart could hear
[ST: XXX XXX XXX ^fast^ XXX XXX]
Like notes which die when born, but still
Haunt the echoes of the hill:
And [ST:the] feeling ever— o too much
The soft vibrations of her touch
As if her gentle hand even now
Lightly [ST:XXX] trembles on my brow
